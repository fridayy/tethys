[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fridayy/tethys.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fridayy/tethys) ![License Apache2](https://go-shields.herokuapp.com/license-apache2-blue.png)

Tethys is a simple proof of concept for a bachelor thesis at the [FH Joanneum Kapfenberg University of Applied Sciences](http://www.fh-joanneum.at).
The main goal of this application is to provide a prototype todo application in order to empirically compare the two popular JavaScript frontend technologies
[ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Angular2](https://angular.io/) by testing their capabilities.

Tethys is currently work in progress and everything is subject to change.

## Running Tethys

In order to run Tethys at its current state a running [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) instance is required.
